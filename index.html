            <p>Every child is ignited by their innocent dreams and each of them has the potential to reach the stars. But the pandemic has filled their world with uncertainty. Through our Umeed initiative, you can lend a helping hand to the disadvantaged children so that their future remains bright. We aim to donate school essentials for primary and high school students from disadvantaged communities across the country. From your generous donations, essentials like notebooks, pencils, backpack, lunchbox, steel water bottle, instrument box, crayons and sanitiser will be bought and distributed. In this pandemic situation when schools are being held online, you can also donate old or damaged electronics such as laptops, smartphones and tablets to help the children access uninterrupted learning.</p>

                <h2>HOW DOES THE FUNDRAISING HAPPEN?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 11px;">Umeed initiative, which started in July 2020, has so far helped 1200+ children with school materials. Our 2021 campaign is set from May 5 to June 30. Till now we have collected 6.4L through our donation campaigns and are happy to receive more donations for this cause. Although the pandemic may cause a delay in the opening of schools, we will begin our drive by the first week of June. We aim to distribute learning materials to 1000 students by the end of June.</p>
                <h2>HOW'S THE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 11px;">Students in the district that are highly beneficial to distribute learning materials can look for it. Rather than looking for different students in different areas, it is preferable to choose any school or field falling behind. In 2020, we went to Badal School in Ernakulam District, Anandamkudi Tribal Colony, Chembur in Thiruvananthapuram District, and Ala Gothuruth Thrissur District.
                    District groups, headed by coordinators, will decide the number of children to distribute in each district, the distribution area, and the distribution materials as per the requirement of each child.According to the number of children needed, funds will be transferred from the Foundation's account to the Coordinator's account regularly.
